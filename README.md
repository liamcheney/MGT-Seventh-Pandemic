# MGT-Seventh-Pandemic

The following custom python scripts were using for developing the seventh pandemic MGT.

Script 1: Identifies core genes that are paralogous and orthologous split into multiple fragments by erroneous assemble and/or annotation. 


Script 2: Determines the quality of allele assembly for each core gene. 


Script 3: Identifies core genes that contain homopolymer tracts of eight of more bases in length.


Script 4: Creates multiple sequence alignment for a core gene. Output is further used in dN/dS calculation.


Script 5: Assigns core genes into MGT levels based on a multifactorial preference system. Genes are organised depending on minimum distance of separation, selection pressure and reliability.


<b>Script 6:</b> A blast-based algorithm for in-silico typing of V. cholerae genomes.
